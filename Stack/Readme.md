Question 1 <br>
Reverse Using Stack <br>
You are given a string s , the task is to reverse the string using stack. <br>
Examples: <br>
Input: s ="GeeksforGeeks" <br>
Output:  skeeGrofskee <br>
Input: s ="Geek" <br>
Output: keeG <br>
Approach:- <br>
Create a stack and push every character into it and then create a empty string and loop over stack until its empty and then concat every character to the new string and return it <br>
Time Complexity-O(n), n is the length of string <br>
Space Complexity - O(n), n is the length of string to put in stack <br>
